![About me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/about_me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Nicholas, a Linux Administrator based in London. I graduated
from the University of Swansea with a First in Theoretical Physics, however
chose to pursue my love for IT after I graduated.

I was fortunate enough to get involved with a couple of startups which provided
me with a great foundation having not completed an IT degree.

I now work at [Rackspace][rs] and get to spend all day working on things that I
would have considered fun to do at home!
