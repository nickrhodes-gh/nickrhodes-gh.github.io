![About me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/about_me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Nicholas, a Linux Admin based in London. I graduated from the University
of Swansea with a First in Theoretical Physics, and chose to pursue my love for
IT after graduating.

I was fortunate enough to become involved with a start-up that needed a
freelance IT manager. It gave me a great introduction to system administration,
having not completed an IT specific degree.

I'm now working at [Rackspace][rackspace], where as well as having the privilege to
learn from some very experienced Linux admins, I also get to play with Linux,
Ansible, Git and loads of other cool tools everyday.

In my spare time I maintain several open source projects,
[Auter](https://github.com/rackerlabs/auter) and
[Configsnap](https://github.com/rackerlabs/configsnap). I also enjoy road
cycling and rock climbing.
