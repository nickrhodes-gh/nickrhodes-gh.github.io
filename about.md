![About me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/about_me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Nicholas, a Linux Admin based in London. I graduated from the University
of Swansea with a First in Theoretical Physics, but chose to pursue my love for
IT.

I was fortunate to get involved with a start-up that needed a freelance IT
manager; it gave me a great introduction to system administration having not
completed an IT specific degree.

I'm now working at [Rackspace][rackspace], where I get to learn from some very
experienced Linux admins, play with Linux, Ansible, Git, and loads of other cool
tools everyday.

In my spare time I maintain open source projects
[Auter](https://github.com/rackerlabs/auter) and
[Configsnap](https://github.com/rackerlabs/configsnap). I also enjoy road
cycling and rock climbing.
