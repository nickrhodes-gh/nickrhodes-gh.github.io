![About me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/about_me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Nicholas, a Linux Administrator based in London. I graduated from the
University of Swansea with a First in Theoretical Physics, however I chose to
pursue my love for IT after graduating.

I was fortunate enough to get involved with a couple of start-up companies that
gave me a great introduction to IT, having not completed an IT specific degree.

I'm now working at [Rackspace][rs], and get to play with Linux, Ansible, Git and
load of other cool tools everyday, as well as having the privilege to learn from
some very experienced Linux admins.

In my spare time I contribute to several open source projects that are
maintained by Rackspace, [Auter](https://github.com/rackerlabs/auter) and
[Configsnap](https://github.com/rackerlabs/configsnap). I also enjoy road
cycling and rock climbing.
