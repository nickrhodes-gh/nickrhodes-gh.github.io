![About me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/about_me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Nicholas, a Linux Administrator based in London. I graduated
from the University of Swansea with a First in Theoretical Physics, however
chose to pursue my love for IT after I graduated.

I was fortunate enough to get involved with a couple of start-up companies which
provided me with a great base foundation, having not completed an IT based
degree.

I'm now working at [Rackspace][rs], and get to play with Linux, Ansible, Git and
load of other cool tools everyday, as well as having the privilege to learn from
some very experienced Linux admins.
