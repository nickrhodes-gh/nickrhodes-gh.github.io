![About me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/about_me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Nicholas, a Linux Admin based in London. I originall graduated from the
University of Swansea with a First in Theoretical Physics, however I chose to
pursue my love for IT after graduating.

I was fortunate enough to become involved in a couple of start-up companies that
gave me a great introduction to IT, having not completed an IT specific degree.

I'm now working at [Rackspace][rs], where as well as having the privilege to
learn from some very experienced Linux admins, I also get to play with Linux,
Ansible, Git and loads of other cool tools everyday.

In my spare time I contribute to several open source projects that are
maintained by Rackspace employees, [Auter](https://github.com/rackerlabs/auter) and
[Configsnap](https://github.com/rackerlabs/configsnap). I also enjoy road
cycling and rock climbing.
